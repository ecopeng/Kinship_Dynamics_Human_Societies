### code
The `R` scripts for the analyses and figures (executions are instructed in [e.sh](#e.sh)).

---

### data
Human relatedness datasets used to test model predictions (data produced from the analyses will also appear here).

---

### demographics
The demographic schedules (survival & fertility) as inputs for the 'hybrid' version of the newly developed model of kinship dynamics used in the study. The datasets `WPP2024_MORT_F04_3_LIFE_TABLE_SURVIVORS_FEMALE.xlsx`, `WPP2024_MORT_F04_2_LIFE_TABLE_SURVIVORS_MALE.xlsx`, and `WPP2024_FERT_F01_FERTILITY_RATES_BY_SINGLE_AGE_OF_MOTHER.xlsx` can be accessed from <https://population.un.org/wpp/downloads?folder=Standard%20Projections&group=Mortality> and <https://population.un.org/wpp/downloads?folder=Standard%20Projections&group=Fertility>.

### model_hybrid
The 'hybrid' version of the newly developed [model of kinship dynamics](https://github.com/ecopeng/Model_Kinship_Dynamics).

---

### e.sh
The shell script to run all the code used.
